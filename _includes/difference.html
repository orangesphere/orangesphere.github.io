              <h4><b>We’ve been there</b>. Your group assembles for a photo and you’re feeling cute!</h4>
              <h4>But when the photos print out, the harsh lighting and exposure ruin your best features.</h4>

            <br>
              <h4>Most photobooth operators take photos, but don't care how their guests look in the photos.</h4>
              <h4>At Fulton Memories, this is <b>all we care about</b>.</h4>
